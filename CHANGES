 Changes
 =========================================================================================

 10.02.1998  - Habe bessere Fehlerroutine eingebaut. Fuehrt nun Programm
               bei schwereren Fehlern nicht mehr aus!
             - Fehler in Fehlermeldung :) behoben
             - Fehlermeldungen abgeaendert
 22.07.1999  - New Version of Tools-Port, made it a Webmin Module
             - Using English instead of German for international use
 27.07.1999  - Added option for allowing use of other services if one fails
 01.08.1999  - Because I added "Find self"-Option in configure I had to
               change CheckBinaries() and some parts of PrintScreen()
 02.08.1999  - Changed the $execline for ping and traceroute
 31.08.1999  - Solved the "Access denied" error!
             - Changes to Ping execline for Solaris (Thanx to Robert Setterlund
               for the information about Solaris)
             - New icon for IP Subnet Calculator
             - Now it is possible to configure options to be used for quick versions
               in configuration module. HOST is a wildcard for the hostname.
             - Better handling of programs, not written for every program but with a
               for-loop checking for programs etc.
             - Changed the handling of errormessages, it's now an array, so all
               encountered errors may be reported, not only one.
             - Much code clean up for better reading, all is in for-loops now
 01.09.1999  - Changed some problem with the init_config on webmin systems < 0.73
 28.09.1999  - Fixed Bug, init_command needed binary also if some progs
               don't need a special binary (as ipsc and whois)
 17.10.1999  - Checked Webmin 0.74 Compliance, all OK
             - Added Dig interface
             - Added GPL header to all files
 15.02.2000  - Long time, since I worked on this module. I will now fix some smaller
               bugs and make it ready for 0.76+
 09.04.2000  - I had to change all ReadParse calls to ReadParse() (braces are important),
               otherwise it doesn't work with Webmin 0.79 !?
 29.06.2000  - Smaller bug fixes and support for simplified chinese. Thanks to
               Leo Liang <leo.liang@turbolinux.com.cn> for this!
 21.07.2000  - Removed OS support restrictions. This module should run on any Webmin
 (0.80.2)      supported platform. This version requires Webmin 0.80+.
