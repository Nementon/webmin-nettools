<A NAME="1"><H3>How many Packets?</H3></A>
How many Packets should this ping command send. 5 is the best in
most cases. If you want to check the network for a longer time you
can set a higher value here. 99 is the maximum.<P>

<A NAME="2"><H3>Packet Size</H3></A>
From the man page of ping: An IP header without options is 20
bytes. An ICMP ECHO_REQUEST (Ping) packet contains additional 8
bytes worth of ICMP header followedby an arbitrary ammount of data.<BR>
Standard is 56, maximum is 9999 bytes.<P>

<A NAME="3"><H3>How many sec between sending each packet?</H3></A>
How many sec should ping wait after sending a packet before it
sends the next packet.<P>

<A NAME="4"><H3>Pattern(s) to send (Hex)?</H3></A>
The data which is send by ping will be filled with this (hex-)pattern.
If you leave this blank ping will fill it with random data. This is useful
if you do not have problems with connectivity itself but with data loss.<P>

<A NAME="5"><H3>Verbosity Output?</H3></A>
From the man page of ping: ICMP packets other than ECHO_Response that are
received are listed.<P>

<A NAME="6"><H3>Numeric Output only?</H3></A>
From the man page of ping: No attempt will be made to lookup symbolic names
for host addresses.<P>

<A NAME="7"><H3>Bypass routing tables?</H3></A>
From the man page of ping: If the host is not a directly-attached network,
an error is returned. This option can be used to ping a local host through
an interface that has no route through it.<P>
